What is DudeTruck?

DudeTruck is an application designed for people to easily find foodtrucks in their area.
It is also designed for foodtruck vendors to be able to advertise their foodtruck.

How do I use DudeTruck?

To use DudeTruck, you must first register an account.  When registering,
select what type of use you are (a regular user or a vendor).  Once registered,
you are free to use the service.  On the search page, you can interact with the map
to see which foodtrucks are located nearby.  All nearby foodtrucks will also be listed.
Selecting a food truck in the listing will take you to that foodtruck's page,
